class_name BoneInstanceService

# Per-piece identity for bones. A bone_id ("arm_bone") names a TYPE; an
# instance_id ("bone#7") names one individual piece and is the source of truth
# for that piece's quality.
#
# Quality is rolled exactly once, when a piece is created (a drop, a reward, a
# newly granted piece). Picking it up, equipping it, opening the inventory,
# applying a build or refreshing the preview all resolve the SAME instance and
# never re-roll.
#
# Deliberate design constraints:
#   * The instance_id carries no meaning. It is "bone#N", never
#     "arm_bone_strong" -- identity, definition and quality stay separate.
#   * The multiplier is not copied onto the instance. Only quality_id is
#     stored; the number comes from BoneQualityService's table, so retuning
#     the table retunes every existing piece.
#   * Legacy plain bone_id Strings keep working through an explicit
#     compatibility path (see resolve). They are never rolled: a String that
#     is not an instance keeps its authored quality, or Normal when it has
#     none. Existing Strings do not silently change meaning.
#
# This service owns instance state only. Quality RULES live in
# BoneQualityService; bone DEFINITIONS live in BoneDatabase / BoneDefinition.
