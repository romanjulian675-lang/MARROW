extends Node3D

# Velocity-driven procedural animation (Marrow rigging brief, Phases B/D/E/F).
# Reads ACTUAL velocity (not raw input) so it reacts to slopes, knockback, and
# speed bonuses, and moves the rig's sockets. Bones parented to sockets follow.

# Fires once per attack when the strike phase begins (see attack_windup_portion),
# i.e. the moment the pose actually "connects" rather than winding up or
# following through. Callers that need to land damage in sync with the
# animation (backstab) should use this instead of a fixed timer guessed to
# roughly line up with attack_overlay_duration.

# The chest bends at the waist and the head/arms follow.
#
# WHY THE HEAD/ARMS ARE NOT REPARENTED UNDER THE CHEST, which is the obvious way
# to make them follow: _capture_rest() stores every socket's PARENT-LOCAL rest
# pose, so reparenting silently redefines what _rest_pos["head"] means, and every
# site that mixes rig space with socket space breaks at once — torso-spring
# (head.position = body.position + offset), the head-only ground constants
# (rig-space -0.85 fused with chest-space rest.x/z), the 12
# _world_horizontal_offset_to_local call sites (rig-basis directions applied in a
# tilted frame), rig.to_local across the player.gd boundary, the doubled crawl
# drops, and — the one nothing warns about — body.scale's squash-and-stretch,
# which would suddenly squash the head and both arms.
#
# So instead of inheriting the chest transform, this ADDS the one transform a real
# hierarchy would have contributed, by hand, after everyone else has written. No
# socket changes parent, so no space changes, and all of the above is structurally
# absent rather than fixed. The cost is order-coupling: this must run last.
