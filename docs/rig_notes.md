# Marrow — Modular Rig / Procedural Animation notes

Isolated prototype for the "Modular Rigging and Procedural Animation" brief.
**Not wired into the real player yet** (brief Phase G) — test it in `rig_test.tscn` first.

## How to test
Open `scenes/rig_test.tscn` in Godot and run it (F6 / "Run Current Scene").

- **WASD** — move. Body bobs, torso leans, arms/legs swing, and the whole figure
  turns smoothly toward the movement direction. Standing still = subtle idle breathing.
- **Attack** — cycles simple combo poses: right-arm strike, left-arm strike,
  then a heavier two-arm/torso finisher.
- **Q** — cycles equipping **Arm → Leg → Heavy** into their slots. The grey limb is
  swapped for a bone-colored one; Heavy is bigger (visual_scale) and heavier.
- Walk **forward onto the ramp** (in front of spawn) to see foot placement (Phase F):
  each foot raycasts down and plants on the surface, tilting to the slope.

## Architecture (animate sockets, not meshes)
- `scripts/rig/modular_skeleton_rig.gd` (`ModularSkeletonRig`) — builds Node3D
  sockets in `_ready()` and hangs a grey box on each. `equip_bone(id, def)` /
  `unequip_slot(slot)` swap the socket's visual. Equipped bones are children of
  sockets, so they inherit socket motion for free.
- `scripts/rig/procedural_player_animator.gd` (`ProceduralPlayerAnimator`) —
  `update_from_player(delta, velocity, max_speed, facing, equipped_defs)` moves
  the sockets from the ACTUAL velocity (so slopes/knockback/speed bonuses all read
  correctly). Layers: idle breathing, walk bob, torso lean/sway, arm+leg swing,
  turn smoothing, weight response.
- `scripts/bone_database.gd` — compatibility layer for bone data; `weight`
  remains the legacy animation weight while `physical_weight`,
  `equipment_weight`, `inventory_weight` and `weight_class` are available for
  future rig/inventory rules.
- `scripts/rig/rig_test_player.gd` — sandbox movement controller (no combat/inventory).

## Tuning variables (exports on ProceduralAnimator)
walk_cycle_speed 8.0 · body_bob_amount 0.08 · body_sway_amount 0.04 ·
torso_lean_amount 0.12 · arm_swing_amount 0.45 · leg_swing_amount 0.35 ·
turn_smoothing 12.0 · idle_breath_amount 0.025 · heavy_weight_swing_slowdown 0.65

## Phase E/F tuning (exports on ProceduralAnimator)
attack_overlay_duration 0.16 · attack_overlay_blend_speed 18 · attack_arm_forward 1.1 ·
attack_torso_twist 0.35 · foot_raycast_up/down 0.6/1.4 · foot_lift 0.06 ·
foot_smoothing 14 · foot_align_to_normal true (uncheck foot_placement_enabled to disable).

Combo overlay:
- `Player` passes a combo step into `ProceduralPlayerAnimator.trigger_attack`.
- Step 1 uses right arm + torso twist.
- Step 2 uses left arm + opposite torso twist.
- Step 3 uses both arms, deeper lunge, and a small head dip.
- This is visual only; melee damage and hitbox behavior are unchanged.

## Current player body progression
- The real player now enables body progression on `ModularSkeletonRig`.
- `Player._setup_procedural_character()` enables
  `player_body_progression_enabled` on `ProceduralPlayerAnimator`; enemies keep
  this disabled.
- The head is the fixed core. Torso must be equipped before arms or legs can
  attach.
- When the torso is missing, `ProceduralPlayerAnimator` uses
  `head_only_ground_socket_y` to place the head socket at ground height instead
  of the normal full-body head rest pose.
- Head-only movement increments `_head_only_roll_angle` from actual horizontal
  travel distance and applies that as rotation, so the head rolls along the
  ground instead of wobbling like a loose limb.
- The head-only vertical hop defaults to `0.0`, keeping the head planted unless
  designers intentionally tune bounce back in.
- The wobble pass skips the head while it is the only equipped core, so it does
  not reset the head back to the full-body rest height or overwrite the roll.
- When the torso is equipped but legs are still missing,
  `ProceduralPlayerAnimator` enters a torso-spring state. The torso compresses,
  launches upward/forward and settles like a spring from
  `torso_spring_ground_socket_y`, with the head placed from
  `torso_spring_head_offset` relative to the springing torso. The head adds a
  delayed `torso_spring_head_pop_amount` bounce so it rises a bit higher than
  the torso and settles back into place by the end of the cycle. The head uses
  extra side drift and rotation during this state so the torso-only movement
  reads more exaggerated than the full-body animation.
- Enemies use `ProceduralEnemyAnimator`, a thin subclass that keeps player body
  progression disabled. This prevents enemies without player equipment records
  from being treated as head-only bodies.
- Once the torso is equipped, the normal body/head rest pose takes over again.

## Body-part hurtboxes
- `ModularSkeletonRig` now creates one `Area3D` hurtbox per socket:
  `head`, `body`, `right_arm`, `left_arm`, `right_leg`, `left_leg`,
  `right_foot` and `left_foot`.
- Hurtboxes live under the same sockets as the visuals, so procedural animation,
  crawling, rolling head movement and equipped-part scaling all move the boxes
  with the visible body part.
- `set_body_hitbox_owner(owner, group)` labels the same socket boxes for the
  owning actor. Player boxes use `player_body_hurtboxes`; enemy boxes use
  `enemy_body_hurtboxes`.
- When a bone is equipped, `equip_bone()` reads `hitbox_size`,
  `hitbox_offset`, `hitbox_scale` and `hitbox_rotation`. If no explicit
  `hitbox_size` is provided, the rig derives the box from the part's visual
  scale and the default limb geometry.
- Player body progression enables only the recovered/equipped body part
  hurtboxes. In the head-only start, only the head hurtbox should receive
  projectile damage.
- Enemies register themselves as the owner of their rig hurtboxes. When limbs
  detach or recover, `Enemy._set_rig_limb_visible()` also disables/enables that
  limb's hurtbox.

## Known limitations / TODO
- Socket positions & limb sizes are hand-estimated grey-box values — expect to
  nudge them once seen in a real window.
- Body facing yaw uses `atan2(facing.x, facing.z)`; if the figure faces backwards,
  flip the sign (orientation not verified visually).
- Attack overlay sign (arm forward/back) not visually verified — flip
  `attack_arm_forward` if it thrusts the wrong way.
- Feet are independent of the swinging leg boxes (no knee IK yet, per the brief's
  grey-box rule); on steep slopes there may be a visible leg/foot gap.
- Foot placement done on flat ground + a ramp; steps not added (CharacterBody3D
  needs step-up logic to climb vertical steps).
- Not merged into the real player (Phase G) — do that only after this feels good.
