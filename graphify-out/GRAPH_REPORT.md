## Corpus Check
- 6 files · ~45,657 words
- Verdict: corpus is large enough that graph structure adds value.

## Summary
- 49 nodes · 53 edges · 6 communities (5 shown, 1 thin omitted)
- Extraction: 100% EXTRACTED · 0% INFERRED · 0% AMBIGUOUS
- Token cost: 0 input · 0 output

## Graph Freshness
- Built from commit: `2f9dd75d`
- Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to check if the graph is stale.
- Run `graphify update .` after code changes (no API cost).

## Community Hubs (Navigation)
- Community 0
- Community 1
- Community 2
- Community 3
- Community 4
- Community 5

## God Nodes (most connected - your core abstractions)
1. `Marrow Project Graph Map` - 13 edges
2. `SimplePdf` - 6 edges
3. `Godot Signal Guidelines` - 6 edges
4. `Marrow Open-World Map Layout Notes` - 6 edges
5. `Marrow — Modular Rig / Procedural Animation notes` - 6 edges
6. `main()` - 5 edges

## Knowledge Gaps
- **28 isolated node(s):** `MARROW`, `Prefer Event Names`, `Signal Up, Call Down`, `Pass Useful Data`, `Keep Emitters Decoupled` (+23 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components.
- **1 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **What connects `MARROW`, `Prefer Event Names`, `Signal Up, Call Down` to the rest of the system?**
  _28 weakly-connected nodes found - possible documentation gaps or missing edges._
- **Should `Community 4` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.14285714285714285 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
