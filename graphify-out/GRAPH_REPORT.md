# Graph Report - MARROW  (2026-07-14)

## Corpus Check
- 7 files · ~46,293 words
- Verdict: corpus is large enough that graph structure adds value.

## Summary
- 58 nodes · 61 edges · 7 communities (6 shown, 1 thin omitted)
- Extraction: 100% EXTRACTED · 0% INFERRED · 0% AMBIGUOUS
- Token cost: 0 input · 0 output

## Graph Freshness
- Built from commit: `7788bb9d`
- Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to check if the graph is stale.
- Run `graphify update .` after code changes (no API cost).

## Knowledge Gaps
- **35 isolated node(s):** `MARROW`, `Inventory`, `Combat`, `Camera`, `Enemies` (+30 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components.
- **1 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **What connects `MARROW`, `Inventory`, `Combat` to the rest of the system?**
  _35 weakly-connected nodes found - possible documentation gaps or missing edges._
- **Should `Community 4` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.13333333333333333 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
